Why im i releasing it like this?
Well it used to use TeamFoundation Server for Visual studio. But due to unexpected issues with the TFS i decided to put it here.

I'm well aware that there is a lack of comments in the code, but most of the stuff is pretty self explainatory.

The application still works, its just the "Sources" that are bad. The websites i used to use are not longer up and running.
It's very possible to use this on any kind of website, as long as it provides 1: Artist 2: Songname 3:Duratation 4: a http link for the mp3 file

But feel free to use this for whatever you like.
